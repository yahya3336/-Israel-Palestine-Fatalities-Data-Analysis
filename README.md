Iâ€™m sharing a data visualization project that maps a deeply human and ongoing tragedy â€” the toll of lives lost and injuries sustained by both Palestinians and Israelis in the context of the occupation and conflict, from 2008 to the present.

ðŸ“Š What the dashboard shows:
Using data from verified sources, the Power BI dashboard presents:

Yearly and cumulative numbers of fatalities and injuries

Disaggregation by location (Occupied Palestinian Territory vs. Israel)

Civilian vs. combatant breakdowns where available

Trends over time to better understand the intensity and shifts in the conflict

ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
This dashboard does not aim to take sides. Instead, it strives to present the data clearly, respectfully, and accurately â€” reminding us that every data point represents a human life affected.

In a world flooded with headlines, data can offer clarity â€” and perhaps, perspective. By turning to facts, we can contribute to a more informed and empathetic discourse.
